# ML tasks university
I had a three semester ML course in the university. Here are the tasks:

firstst semester contained Python basics and working with some libraries for EDA.
Notebook names: `Ogneva_ml_tasks`, `Ogneva_ML_final_task` (we also had tasks on the contester, they are not presented here)

In the secondnd and third semesters we had 11 ML tasks
Notebooks are also presented: `Ogneva ML task N`, where N=1, ..., 11.

`diamonds-eda-regression` is an English version of task 11. It is also available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/taniaogneva/diamonds-eda-regression
