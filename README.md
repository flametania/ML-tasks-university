# ML tasks university
I had a three semester ML course in the university. Here are the tasks:

Ist semester contained Python basics and working with some libraries for EDA.
Notebook names: `Ogneva_ml_tasks`, `Ogneva_ML_final_task` (we also had tasks on the contester, they are not presented here)

In the IInd and IIIrd semesters we had 11 ML tasks
Notebooks are also presented: `Ogneva ML task N`, where N=1, ..., 11.
